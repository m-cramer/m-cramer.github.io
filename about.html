      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture of Madison Cramer" />

      <p>I remember it clearly—I was perched against a wall during first grade recess, writing down my latest ideas for the spiral-bound story I had been working on for that entire year. What had started as a measly assignment turned into a 100-page story with a mind of its own. Although I didn’t know it at the time, this was the start of my passion for writing.</p>

      <p>Through the years, I continued to write, and when I reached high school, it took a journalistic turn. I joined my high school’s newspaper, where I became editor of the entertainment section. I learned the ins and outs of writing for a news publication, and it fueled my desire to continue this style of writing in college.</p>

      <p>The little girl who spent all of her free time writing had no clue that it would take her to where she is today: studying Broadcast Journalism at the University of Miami. While in school, I hope to further practice my writing skills and become fully prepared for a career in the field.</p>

      <p>Ideally, I would love to report on either sports or entertainment, and I certainly have a passion for both topics. I follow both religiously and can’t imagine my life without them.</p>

      <p>I’m tenacious. I’m passionate. I go for what I want and don’t stop until I get it. I’m a writer through and through– always have been and always will be.</p>
